## Troubleshooting

### OpenGL

Make sure you have latest GPU drivers installed. If that doesn't help and you run Win 10/11
you can try to install DirectX 12 and then install official OpenGL compatibility layer from Microsoft:
[https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9nqpsl29bfff](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9nqpsl29bfff){: target="_blank"}.

If you only have an integrated graphics card (iGPU), like Intel HD series found on some laptops or netbooks,
you might try using [GLDirect](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gldirect/){: target="_blank"}.

* download it, unpack the .zip file, go to `bin/release` folder
* you will find `opengl32.dll` file
* copy it to your game directory

### How to find my game directory

If you have game shortcut in your Start Menu or on your Desktop then:

* right-click it, and select **Open file location**
* if it takes you to a shortcut, right-click that shortcut and select **Open file location** again
