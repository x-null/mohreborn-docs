## Install

* Extract (unzip) the files.
* Copy all file to your game directory.
* When asked to replace files, select "Replace All" option.
* You are good to go! Enjoy your game!

!!! tip "Running on Linux"

    Remember to set files as executable with `chmod +x <main executable>`, for example `chmod +x mohaa_lnxded`.
    
    On modern x64 bit distros, you need to install 32bit compatiblity layer to run MoH servers.
    For a Debian-based distro that would be:
      

    `sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386`

    `sudo apt-get update`

    `sudo apt-get install libstdc++5:i386`
